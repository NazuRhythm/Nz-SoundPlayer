## Description 
I wanted to handle audio in a script I was developing separately, so I looked for a tool that would allow me to check it easily, but there was none, so I created my own.
I did not intend to make it public because I created it for my own use, but I decided to make it public because it would be a waste of my time.

If you open the menu with the command, the CPU usage will be very high, but I don't intend to improve this because I only want to use it for my own use and check it.

So if you are running a server, I recommend not to do it on that server.
I take no responsibility for this.

Please use it with that understanding.
I will not support it.

## UseCase
Type Command.
```
/soundplayer
```

## Installations 

### 1. Donwload This Script
download this script from [latest](https://github.com/NazuRhythm/Nz-SoundPlayer/release/latest)

### 2. write this on your server.cfg
```lua
ensure Nz-SoundPlayer
```
